# cPlayer (Dark Edition)

**As of July 7, 2025 I have stopped development of cPlayer (Dark Edition) and will only be developing cPlayer (Bright Edition) going forward. See my other repositories to download cPlayer (Bright Edition). It is much more richly featured and with a lot more love poured into it, so check it out!
This repo will stay up in case anyone wants to fork it and work on additional features for cPlayer (Dark Edition) but don't expect any work from me.**

cPlayer is my pet project, which started in 2014 when I thought to myself ... wouldn't it be cool if I could play Rock Band 3 customs like if they were regular songs?
Over time it's grown to display the MIDI contents, to display lyrics in various modes including a Karaoke-style mode, and so on to make the most use of the information contained within Rock Band files.
By now, cPlayer has expanded beyond the original Xbox 360 Rock Band files, also playing its PS3 and Wii counterparts, as well as playing songs from BandFuse, Power Gig, Rocksmith 2014, YARG, Clone Hero, Phase Shift, Guitar Hero World Tour: Definitive Edition and most recently, Fortnite Festival.

As of December 22, 2024, cPlayer (Bright Edition) has arrived, along with a host of new features for both the Bright Edition and this ("Dark Edition"), which will continue to receive support for now.
There's been significant code changes from v3.0.0 to v4.0.0 hence why I'm jumping an entire version number. Please report any bugs or feature requests on here or on the C3 Discord.

cPlayer is designed to be intuitive and easy to use, so just play around with it. There is a Help document but it is severely outdated. Now that this is open source - you improve it! If you do, please send me the updated copy so I can distribute it.

cPlayer is written in C# using .NET Framework 4.8.1 and using Visual Studio 2022 Community Edition. For best results make sure you use the same.

If you have technical questions or want to discuss cPlayer with me, I can be found in most Rock Band related Discord servers under the same username. **I also have my own Discord server called "Nemo's Nautilus".** Send me a message and let's talk.

Enjoy.
