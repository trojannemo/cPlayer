# cPlayer

This is my first attempt at going open source with my software, so please be kind if i'm not doing the Github thing correctly.

The program is easy to use so just play around with it. There is a Help document but it is severely outdated. Now that this is open source - you improve it!

If you're going to just download and compile without much or any editing to the source code, please make sure to download everything in the /bin/ folder and put in a /bin/ folder wherever your executable is. These are all the dependencies and third-party tools cPlayer expects to have access to.

If you have technical questions or want to discuss cPlayer with me, I can be found in most Rock Band related Discord servers under the same username. Send me a message and let's talk.

Enjoy.
