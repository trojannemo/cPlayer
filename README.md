## ⚠️ Project Status — Archived

All future development effort is focused on **cPlayer (Bright Edition)**.

- Please see my other repositories to download **cPlayer (Bright Edition)**
- It is more feature-rich, actively developed, and built with significantly more care and polish

This repository will remain online **for archival purposes** and in case anyone wishes to **fork the project** and continue development independently.

> Do not expect further updates, fixes, or features from me on this branch.

## About

**cPlayer** is my long-running pet project, originally started in **2014**, born from a simple idea:

> *Wouldn’t it be cool if Rock Band 3 customs could be played like regular songs?*

Over time, cPlayer evolved into a full-featured music player capable of:

- Displaying MIDI contents
- Showing lyrics in multiple modes, including **Karaoke-style playback**
- Visualizing and leveraging the rich metadata contained in rhythm game files

What began as an Xbox 360 Rock Band–focused tool has since grown well beyond that scope.

---

## Supported Game Formats

Over its lifetime, cPlayer has expanded to support content from:

- Rock Band (Xbox 360, PS3, Wii)
- BandFuse
- Power Gig
- Rocksmith 2014
- YARG
- Clone Hero
- Phase Shift
- Guitar Hero World Tour: Definitive Edition
- Fortnite Festival

## Bright Edition Transition

As of **December 22, 2024**, **cPlayer (Bright Edition)** was introduced alongside a major evolution of the codebase.

Both editions briefly received updates during this transition period.

Due to **significant architectural changes** between versions **3.0.0** and **4.0.0**, the version number was intentionally advanced to reflect the scope of those changes.

Bug reports and feature requests from that transition period were handled via GitHub and the C3 Discord.

---

## Usability & Documentation

cPlayer is designed to be **intuitive and easy to use**, and most users should be able to explore it without guidance.

A Help document exists, but it is **severely outdated**.

Now that this project is open source:

- Improve it
- Update the documentation
- Fix what’s broken

If you do, please consider sending me the updated documentation so I can redistribute it for others.

---

## Development Environment

- **Language:** C#  
- **Framework:** .NET Framework **4.8.1**  
- **IDE:** Visual Studio **2022 Community Edition**

For best results, use the same environment.

---

## Community & Support

If you have technical questions or want to discuss cPlayer:

- You can find me in most **Rock Band–related Discord servers** under the same username
- I also run my own Discord server:

**“Nemo’s Nautilus”**

Send me a message and let’s talk.

## Final Notes

This project had a long life, evolved far beyond its original scope, and helped pave the way for what eventually became **cPlayer (Bright Edition)**.

This repository remains available **for reference, experimentation, and forking**.

Enjoy.
