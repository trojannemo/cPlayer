# cPlayer

cPlayer is my pet project, which started in 2014 when I thought to myself ... wouldn't it be cool if I could play Rock Band 3 customs like if they were regular songs?
Over time it's grown to display the MIDI contents, to display lyrics in various modes including a Karaoke-style mode, and so on to make the most use of the information contained within Rock Band files.
By now, cPlayer can play not only the original Xbox 360 Rock Band files, but also its PS3 and Wii counterparts, as well as play songs from BandFuse, Power Gig, Rocksmith 2014, YARG, Clone Hero, Phase Shift, Guitar Hero World Tour: Definitive Edition and most recently, Fortnite Festival.

The program is easy to use so just play around with it. There is a Help document but it is severely outdated. Now that this is open source - you improve it!

If you're going to just download and compile without much or any editing to the source code, please make sure to download everything in the /bin/ folder and put it in a /bin/ folder wherever your executable is. These are all the dependencies and third-party tools cPlayer expects to have access to.

cPlayer is written in C# using .NET Framework 4.8.1 and using Visual Studio 2022 Community Edition. For best results make sure you use the same.

If you have technical questions or want to discuss cPlayer with me, I can be found in most Rock Band related Discord servers under the same username. Send me a message and let's talk.

Enjoy.
